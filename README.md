# similarity-centroid-object-tracker
Centroid tracking algorithm for object tracking is a powerful method in terms it is extremely compute efficient but often leads to ID switching and ID loss. This project introduces a similarity layer on top of it which trades-off some compute for higher accuracy while maintaining an overall deployable speed/accuracy trade-off.
